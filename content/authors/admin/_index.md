Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate in Finance at the Stockholm School of Economics and Swedish House of Finance. My research interests include corporate finance, mutual funds, credit markets and governance. I like working with different data and retrieving new datasets. I have a growing interest in machine learning applications to financial economics.
