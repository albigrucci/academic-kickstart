Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate in Finance at the Stockholm School of Economics. My research interests lie in empirical corporate finance in a broad sense and I enjoy working with large and new datasets to answer interesting questions that are policy-relevant. I have an interest in data science as well, which I have developed further through using Python and SQL for my research projects. 

My Job Market Paper looks at conflicts of interests between mutual fund families and passive funds sponsored by them. I also investigated the corporate governance issue of informational disadvantage of independent directors; and, moreover, how access to bond markets may improve firmsâ€™ prospects during a crisis. 

I am on the job market in 2019-2020, and will be available for interviews at the European Job Market in Rotterdam and the ASSA meetings in San Diego.
