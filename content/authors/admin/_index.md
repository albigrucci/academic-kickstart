Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate in Finance at the Stockholm School of Economics. My research interests lie in empirical corporate finance in a broad sense and I enjoy working with large and new datasets to answer interesting questions that are policy-relevant. I also have an interest in causal inference, machine learning applied to Economics and Finance  and data science, which I have developed further by using Python, R and SQL for my research projects. 

My Job Market Paper examines conflicts of interests between mutual fund families and passive funds sponsored by them. I also investigated the corporate governance issue of informational disadvantage of independent directors; and, moreover, how access to bond markets may improve firmsâ€™ prospects during a bank crisis.
